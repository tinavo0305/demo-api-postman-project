## Introduction
<br /> This project is used to demonstrate my expertise in REST API testing using Postman.
<br /> Application to use: TRELLO app
<br /> Test flow:
1. Use POST request to create a new board
2. Use PUT request to update the name of the board
3. Use GET request to view the board
4. Use DELETE request to delete the board
5. Use GET request to check the board does not exist
Write with Javascript for each request to check that the request performed as expected.
